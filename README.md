# Getaround â€” Delay Analysis & Pricing Optimization (Deployment Project)

Getaround is a peer-to-peer car rental platform where late vehicle returns can disrupt subsequent rentals and impact both customer satisfaction and owner revenues. This project analyzes rental delays to evaluate policy trade-offs and deploys a machine learning model for dynamic pricing optimization.

This repository contains two main components:  

1. **Delay Analysis Dashboard**: data analysis on late returns and rental overlaps, deployed as a Streamlit web app.  
2. **Pricing Optimization**: a Machine Learning pipeline deployed as both a REST API (FastAPI) and a user-facing Streamlit app.  

Both are hosted in production on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 1. Delay Analysis (Streamlit Dashboard)

### Purpose
Quantify the operational and financial impact of late returns and test policies for enforcing a minimum delay between rentals.  

### Analyses implemented
- Percentage of owner revenue affected by enforcing different delay thresholds.  
- Number of rentals blocked under various configurations (all cars vs. *Connect* cars only).  
- Distribution of late check-ins and impact on the next driver.  
- Estimation of problematic cases resolved by different policy thresholds.  

### Deployment
- **Production app**: [Streamlit Delay Analysis](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sony9316/Streamlit-delay-analysis)  
- **Source code**: `Delay_analysis_dashboard_Streamlit/`

## 2. Pricing Optimization (Machine Learning Model)

### Purpose
Train and deploy a supervised ML model to predict optimal rental prices based on car specifications and equipment.  

### API (FastAPI)
- **Endpoint**: [POST /predict](https://sony9316-getaround-pricing-api.hf.space/predict)  
- **Swagger Docs**: [API Documentation](https://sony9316-getaround-pricing-api.hf.space/docs)  
- **Source code**: `ML_pricing_prediction_API/`  

### Example API request (inference)

```python
import requests

payload = {
    "input": [{
        "model_key": "Peugeot",
        "mileage": 174631,
        "engine_power": 120,
        "fuel": "diesel",
        "paint_color": "black",
        "car_type": "convertible",
        "private_parking_available": True,
        "has_gps": True,
        "has_air_conditioning": True,
        "automatic_car": False,
        "has_getaround_connect": True,
        "has_speed_regulator": True,
        "winter_tires": False
    }]
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://sony9316-getaround-pricing-api.hf.space/predict",
    json=payload
)

print(response.json())

## 3. Pricing Streamlit App

**Purpose**  
Provide a user-friendly web interface to interact with the pricing model without needing to query the API directly.  

**Features**  
- Input car characteristics (model, mileage, fuel, options, etc.).  
- Submit request to the deployed pricing API.  
- Display predicted rental price in real time.  

**Deployment**  
- Production app: [Streamlit Pricing App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sony9316/Getaround_pricing_streamlit)  
- Source code: `ML_pricing_prediction_Streamlit/`
